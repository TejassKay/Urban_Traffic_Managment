Smart Traffic Management for Urban Planning
Hackathon Project Prototype
Vision
A smart traffic management system that utilizes real-time data to optimize traffic flow in urban environments, reduce congestion, and improve overall transportation efficiency. This prototype simulates a city grid and demonstrates how adaptive traffic signal control can respond to changing traffic patterns.

Key Features
Real-time Traffic Simulation: A visual representation of vehicles moving through a city grid.

Dynamic Traffic Light Control: Traffic signals that can adapt their timing based on traffic volume.

Data Visualization: Real-time display of key metrics like vehicle count, average speed, and wait times.

Event Simulation: Ability to introduce events like road closures or accidents to see how the system adapts.

Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

Visualization: HTML5 Canvas for the simulation.

Libraries: No external libraries are used in this prototype to keep it lightweight and easy to understand.

How to Run
Clone this repository.

Open the index.html file in a modern web browser.

The simulation will start automatically.

Use the controls to interact with the simulation.

Future Ideas
Integrate machine learning to predict traffic patterns.

Use real-world map data (e.g., OpenStreetMap).

Add different vehicle types (cars, buses, emergency vehicles).

Develop a more sophisticated data dashboard.
